## Project Description

In this project, we are building a pothole detection system using the YOLOv5 deep learning framework. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is known for its real-time object detection capabilities and can be adapted for various tasks, including pothole detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of annotated images and videos containing potholes. It is essential to have a diverse and well-annotated dataset for training a robust model. Data preprocessing and augmentation may also be necessary to enhance model performance. We have used a combination of datasets ranging from [RDD2020](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/rdd-2020), [Roboflow Pothole images Dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/pothole/1) 

## YOLOv5

YOLOv5 is the fifth version of the YOLO architecture, which is designed for real-time object detection tasks. It offers various pre-trained models and can be fine-tuned on custom datasets. YOLOv5 is written in PyTorch and is highly customizable.

## Training

To train the YOLOv5 model for pothole detection, the following steps are typically involved:

1. Data Preparation: Organize the dataset, split it into training and validation sets, and create annotation files.

2. Model Configuration: Choose a YOLOv5 variant (e.g., YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m) and modify the configuration files to suit your dataset and task.

3. Training: Train the model on a GPU-enabled machine, monitoring training metrics like loss and accuracy.

4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean Average Precision).

5. Fine-tuning: If necessary, fine-tune the model to improve its performance.

## Inference

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it for real-world pothole detection:

1. Input: Provide images or videos as input to the trained model.

2. Inference: Run the model's inference pipeline to detect and locate potholes.

3. Visualization: Visualize the results, highlighting detected potholes and their coordinates.

## Results

Document the results of your pothole detection system, including:

- Model performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
- Sample visualizations with detected potholes.
- Any challenges or limitations encountered during the project.

## Future Improvements

Consider potential improvements and future work for the project, such as:

- Increasing the dataset size and diversity.
- Implementing real-time detection on edge devices.
- Fine-tuning the model for better accuracy.
- Deploying the system in a real-world scenario.
